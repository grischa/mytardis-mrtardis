		    <p>There is a pressing need for the archival and curation of raw data. However, the relatively large size of such data has presented challenges for storage in a single worldwide repository.  This problem can be avoided by using a federated approach, where each institution or university utilizes its institutional repository.</p>

		<p>In addition to ensuring that valuable data is not lost, the provision of raw data has several uses for scientific communities. Often, results can only be truly repeated or verified when the raw data is available.  In addition, the availability of raw data is extremely useful for the development of improved methods of analysis and data processing.</p>
