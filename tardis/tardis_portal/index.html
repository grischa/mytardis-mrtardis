						<strong>TARDIS</strong> is a multi-institutional collaborative venture that aims to facilitate the archiving and sharing of raw X-ray diffraction images (collectively known as a 'dataset') from the protein crystallography community. Whereas the model coordinates and (less often) the structure factors (processed experimental data) are stored in the <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do">PDB</a> the raw diffraction data is often not available. Addressing this shortcoming is the central aim of TARDIS. There are several reasons why we feel this is important (see <a href="/about">about</a>), which can be summarised as:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The availability of raw data is extremely useful for the development of improved methods of image analysis and data processing.
						</li>
						<li>Fostering the archival of raw data at an institutional level is one the best ways of ensuring that this data is not lost (laboratory archives are typically volatile)
						</li>
					</ul>
					<br/>
