# Secure FTP Applet Runtime Properties
# 
# This file may be used to define runtime properties for Secure FTP Applet.
# This file should be placed in the same directory as the language.txt properties 
# file.
# 
# When the applet loads it will first look for runtime properties in the applet
# parameters provided.  If the applet parameter is not found it will then look 
# in the params.txt file.
#
# This allows you to provide runtime properties as applet parameters or in the 
# params.txt file, with applet parameters taking precedence.  This ensures backwards 
# compatibility with previous versions of Secure FTP Applet.
#
# A list of available Secure FTP Applet runtime properties may be found in the Secure 
# FTP Applet online documentation at http://www.jscape.com/sftpapplet/docs.html
#
# For technical support please contact support@jscape.com for a prompt response.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTES: 
#
# 1. Lines beginning with a pound sign will be treated as comments and ignored by Secure 
# FTP Applet. 
# 
# 2. Runtime properties defined in the params.txt file are case sensitive. Therefore it is 
# important that the property name used match the name provided in the Secure FTP Applet 
# documentation exactly.  
# 
# Below are example runtime properties.
# 

# set FTP hostname
hostname = ftp.netscape.com

# set FTP username
username = anonymous

# set FTP password
password = user@here.com

# set transfer mode
mode = binary

# set applet background color
bgColor = FFFFFF
